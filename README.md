# AntiBug
Bug and project tracking web app.

This is the first ever project I built myself and I truly enjoyed the process. 

# How to use the site
Login using "Fredo" as username and "password" as password, or create your own profile by signing up.

Once logged in, start by creating a new project. Once you've created a project with a name, description, status and deadline, you can add bugs to that project by clicking on the project in the table. 
You can edit and delete all of your own bugs and projects.
Idea of the site is, once you start a project, you log it on the app and you can then keep track of any bugs you might (will) run into. This will help you resolve reoccurring bugs easier and faster.

# What I learnt, what I struggled with
As this was my first from-scratch project, the amount of things I learned was huge.
How to plan and design your project, to deploying it in the end, the whole process was new to me and I gained invaluable experince from it.

This is also my first experinece in using SQL database. My previous experinece was with MongoDB and I decided to use MySQL to expand my knowledge. The biggest thing I learnt, was I should have used NoSQL database for this project. 
I managed to understand the basics of MySQL and Sequelize quite well, but I think a SQL database is not the best choice for this particular project.

Logging and describing different bugs and projects can sometimes use a little flexibility that SQL databases don't offer.
Also, with NoSQL database it would have been easier to find bugs between different projects, where as in current SQL db you have to find a project first and then the bug.

I really enjoyed making this app and I believe it was this process that really solidified my passion for software development. I also use it every time I start a new project.

# You never forget your first
